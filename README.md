CUDA RayTracing
======

This is just a case of study in CUDA, the raytracing implemented here is REALLY basic, based on a previous university project totally implemented on CPU and on the "Accelerated Ray Tracing in One Weekend in CUDA" tutorial. The 'master' branch contains the raytracing CUDA implementation and the 'no_cuda' contains the basic CPU one.

<h2>Compiling and Running</h2>
